     * <p>
     * The registration behaviour depends on the availability of an API provider:
     * <ul>
     * <li>If the API providing mod has not yet been initialized, the plugin will be put in
     * a queue, and {@code registerPlugin} will return immediately.
     * Such early plugins will be called back at a later time, when the provider initializes.</li>
     * <li>If the providing mod has already been initialized, the plugin will be initialized
     * immediately. {@code registerPlugin} will return once the initialization has been performed.</li>
     * <li>If no API providing mod are available in the current game instance, {@code registerPlugin}
     * will return immediately, and the plugin's methods will never get called.</li>
     * </ul>
     * In any case, the plugin instance will be added to the list of registered plugins and will
     * be immediately accessible through {@link #getRegisteredPlugins()}.
     * <p>
     * This method can be called off-thread, although doing so is discouraged as there are
     * no guarantee regarding which thread the plugin's methods will be called on.
